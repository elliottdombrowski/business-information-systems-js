## If the final number is between 1 and 1000, the user will be presented with a prompt confirming that they have won.
## Otherwise, the user will be presented with a prompt confirming that they have lost.

# NOTES

### While recognizing that the example's modal appears to be a JavaScript alert, I chose to recreate the modal independently, as the example's alert does not match the current JS Alert appearance. 
### I designed a modal similar to the provided example, and display / hide via JavaScript styles.
